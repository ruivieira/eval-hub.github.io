The EvalHub MCP server exposes four tools: one for discovering evaluation providers and three for managing evaluation jobs.

## Tool: discover_providers

Discover evaluation providers using [agent metadata](/mcp/agent-discoverability/). Filter by target type and capability tags to find the right provider for a use case. Each result includes a summary, usage hints, result interpretation guidance, and complementary provider suggestions.

### Parameters

| Parameter     | Type       | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target_type` | string     | No       | Filter by target type: `model`, `agent`, or `inference_server`              |
| `evaluates`   | string[]   | No       | Filter to providers whose `agent.evaluates` includes **all** listed tags    |

When any filter is set, providers without an `agent` block are excluded.

### Example request

Find model providers that evaluate safety:

```json
{
  "evaluates": ["safety"],
  "target_type": "model"
}
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "garak",
      "name": "garak",
      "title": "Garak",
      "summary": "Red-team an LLM for safety vulnerabilities, toxicity, and OWASP risks",
      "target_type": "model",
      "evaluates": ["safety", "security", "red_teaming", "toxicity"],
      "hints": [
        "The model endpoint must support OpenAI-compatible chat completions",
        "The 'quick' benchmark runs a single DAN probe for fast smoke testing (~2 min)"
      ],
      "result_interpretation": [
        "attack_success_rate measures how often the model was successfully exploited",
        "LOWER is better -- 0.0 means no attacks succeeded",
        "Scores above 0.3 indicate significant vulnerability"
      ],
      "complements": ["lm_evaluation_harness", "guidellm"],
      "recommended_when": [
        "User asks about model safety or toxicity",
        "Pre-deployment safety gate"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response metadata

The response includes a `_meta` object with diagnostic fields useful for debugging filter behavior:

| Field                | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `target_types_found` | Comma-separated target types present in results      |
| `target_type`        | The `target_type` filter that was applied             |
| `evaluates_found`    | Comma-separated evaluates tags present in results    |
| `evaluates`          | The `evaluates` filter that was applied               |

### Notes

- Without filters, all providers are returned (including those without `agent` metadata).
- Prefer this tool over reading `evalhub://providers` when you need filtered, agent-oriented summaries.
- `recommended_when` and `complements` are returned for display; they are not filterable parameters.
- See [Agent Discoverability](/mcp/agent-discoverability/) for the full metadata model.

Submit a new model evaluation job.

```

### Notes

- You must provide either `benchmarks` or `collection`, not both.
- If `benchmarks` is provided, it must not be empty.
- Use `get_job_status` to monitor the submitted job.

---

## Tool: cancel_job

Cancel a running or pending evaluation job.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                  |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `job_id`  | string | Yes      | The job identifier to cancel |

### Example response

```json
{
  "job_id": "job-a1b2c3d4",
  "message": "Job job-a1b2c3d4 cancelled successfully"
}
```

### Notes

- Cancellation stops running benchmarks and marks them as cancelled.
- Use `get_job_status` to verify the final state after cancellation.

:::note
When a benchmark reaches a terminal state (completed or failed), the response is enriched with `result_interpretation` and `complements` from the provider's agent metadata. These fields are omitted for benchmarks still in progress.

### Job states

| State              | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `pending`          | Job is queued and waiting to start       |
| `running`          | One or more benchmarks are executing     |
| `completed`        | All benchmarks finished successfully     |
| `failed`           | One or more benchmarks failed            |
| `cancelled`        | Job was cancelled by the user            |
| `partially_failed` | Some benchmarks completed, others failed |

### Notes

- This tool is designed for polling — call it repeatedly to monitor a running evaluation.
- `progress_percent` ranges from 0 to 100.
- Each benchmark entry includes individual timestamps when available.
